TL;DR: ralc is no longer hosted on GitHub. Find it on GitLab!

For some time now, GitHub has been abandoning its culture of sharing based on the principles of openness, meritocracy and equality for all contributors, regardless of race and gender; all aparently due to pressure from political groups.

Hearing about the internal restructuring over at GitHub was the final nail in the coffin that pushed me to accept that GitHub has lost track of the values that made it grow.

So with that, I (@pappad) will stop using GitHub for all my projects and will no longer recommend it for people looking to host theirs.

I will now use GitLab for hosting git repos and my profile can be found on gitlab.

So long GitHub, and thanks for all the git!

###INTRO:
R.A.L.C is an acronymn for Randomized Adventure Lore Creator, it is the
combined effort of freedom-loving DND nerds to be collectively
lazier by means of effort.

###SCREENSHOT:
![](http://s4.postimg.org/wi5a66kkd/ralcv0_65.png)

###PURPOSE:
The aim of this project is to adhere as close to the DNDv5 book as
possible, whilst remaining flexible, extensible, modifiable,
configurable, portable, and modular in nature. It is, and will remain
cross-platform free software.

###DEPENDENCIES:
`python2.7
python-tk
python-pil
python-pil.imagetk`

###USAGE:
This program tries to be as cross-platform as possible, but will run best on
a linux-based system. Reguardless, it _should_ run on any environment that
has a python2.7 installation with the required dependancies.

Make sure to clone with the --recursive tag or initilize the submodules.

Run as:
`python2 main.py`
A GUI will then appear with an option to create a new area, or
save/load/new character sheet.
