# Personality Trait				bg[0] 
I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I cannot help it- I am a perfectionist, I am a snob who looks down on those who cannot appreciate fine art, I always want to know how things work and what makes people sick, I am full of witty aphorisms and have a proverb for every occasion, I am rude to people who lack my commitment to hard work and fair play, I like to talk at length about my profession, I do not part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible, I am well known for my work, and I want to make sure everyone appreciates it. I am always taken aback when people have not heard of me

# Ideals						bg[1]
Community: It is the duty of all civilized people to strengthen the bonds of community and security of civilization (Lawful), Generosity: My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Good), Freedom: Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic), Greed: I am only in it for the money. (Evil), People: I am committed to the people I care about, no to ideals. (Neutral), Aspiration: I work hard to be the best is at my craft

# Bonds							bg[2]
The workshop where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me, I created a great work for someone and then found them unworthy to recieve it. I am still looking for someone worthy, I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the person I am today, I pursue wealth to secure someones love, One day I will return to my guild and prove I am the greatest artisan of them all, I will get revenge on the evil forces that destroyed my place of business and ruined my livelighood.

# Flaws							bg[3]
I will do anything to get my hand on something rare or priceless, I am quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me., No one must every learn that I once stole money from guild coffers, I am never satisfied with that I have- I always want more., I would kill to acquire a noble title., I am horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my hardwork. Everywhere I go I am surrounded by rivals.
