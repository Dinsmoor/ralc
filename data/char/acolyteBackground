# Personality Traits		bg[0]
I idoize a particular hero of my faith and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example,I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies empathizing with them and always working toward peace,I see omens in every event and action. The gods to try speak to us. We just need to listen, Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude, I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation,I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods, I've enjoyed find food, drink, and high society among the temple's elite. Rough living grates on me, I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world.

I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was long ago, I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic, I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died, Everything I do is for the common people, I will do anything to protect the temple where I served, I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy 

# Flaws				bg[3]
I judge others harshly and myself even more severly, I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy, My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god, I am inflexible in my thinking, I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them, Once I pick a goal I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life
